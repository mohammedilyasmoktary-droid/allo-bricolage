## Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Already Done
- [x] Database configured on Hostinger
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub
- [x] Frontend built (`frontend/dist/` ready)

### ⏳ Need to Do

#### 1. Upload Frontend Files

**Location of files on your computer:**
```
/Users/ilyasmoktary/Documents/foryou/frontend/dist/
```

**Files to upload:**
- `index.html`
- `assets/` folder
- `images/` folder (if exists)

**Where to upload on Hostinger:**
- Go to: Hostinger → Websites → alobricolage.com → Files → File Manager
- Navigate to: `public_html/` folder
- Upload the files directly into `public_html/` (not in a subfolder)

**Verify:**
- `index.html` must be directly in `public_html/`
- `assets/` folder must be directly in `public_html/`

#### 2. Test Your Website

1. Visit: `https://alobricolage.com`
2. If it loads: ✅ Success! You can share the link!
3. If not: Check file locations

#### 3. Deploy Backend (For Full Functionality)

For login, registration, and data to work, backend needs to be deployed:

**Options:**
- Hostinger Node.js hosting (if available)
- Railway.app (free tier)
- Render.com (free tier)
- VPS (if you have one)

## Your Shareable Links

Once frontend is uploaded:

- **Main Website:** `https://alobricolage.com`
- **Login:** `https://alobricolage.com/login`
- **Register:** `https://alobricolage.com/register`
- **Homepage:** `https://alobricolage.com`

## Quick Upload Steps

1. **Open Hostinger File Manager**
2. **Go to `public_html/` folder**
3. **Click "Upload"**
4. **Select files from:** `/Users/ilyasmoktary/Documents/foryou/frontend/dist/`
5. **Upload:** `index.html` and `assets/` folder
6. **Test:** Visit `https://alobricolage.com`

## After Upload

Once files are uploaded:
- ✅ Website will be live
- ✅ You can share `https://alobricolage.com`
- ✅ People can visit and see your website

**Note:** Backend features (login, data) will need backend deployment to work fully.
